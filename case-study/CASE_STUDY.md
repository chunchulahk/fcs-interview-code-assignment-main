    # Case Study Scenarios to discuss
    
    ## Scenario 1: Cost Allocation and Tracking
    **Situation**: The company needs to track and allocate costs accurately across different Warehouses and Stores. The costs include labor, inventory, transportation, and overhead expenses.
    
    **Task**: Discuss the challenges in accurately tracking and allocating costs in a fulfillment environment. Think about what are important considerations for this, what are previous experiences that you have you could related to this problem and elaborate some questions and considerations
    
    **Questions you may have and considerations:**
    Tracking costs is difficult because many costs are shared between warehouses and stores. Clear rules, proper allocation logic, and historical data preservation are important to avoid confusion.
    
    ## Scenario 2: Cost Optimization Strategies
    **Situation**: The company wants to identify and implement cost optimization strategies for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to reduce overall costs without compromising service quality.
    
    **Task**: Discuss potential cost optimization strategies for fulfillment operations and expected outcomes from that. How would you identify, prioritize and implement these strategies?
    
    **Questions you may have and considerations:**
    Cost can be optimized by improving warehouse utilization, reducing excess inventory, and optimizing transport routes. Decisions should be based on data analysis without affecting customer service.
    
    ## Scenario 3: Integration with Financial Systems
    **Situation**: The Cost Control Tool needs to integrate with existing financial systems to ensure accurate and timely cost data. The integration should support real-time data synchronization and reporting.
    
    **Task**: Discuss the importance of integrating the Cost Control Tool with financial systems. What benefits the company would have from that and how would you ensure seamless integration and data synchronization?
    
    **Questions you may have and considerations:**
    Integration with finance systems ensures accurate and real-time cost data. It helps in reporting, auditing, and avoiding mismatches between operational and financial numbers.
    
    ## Scenario 4: Budgeting and Forecasting
    **Situation**: The company needs to develop budgeting and forecasting capabilities for its fulfillment operations. The goal is to predict future costs and allocate resources effectively.
    
    **Task**: Discuss the importance of budgeting and forecasting in fulfillment operations and what would you take into account designing a system to support accurate budgeting and forecasting?
    
    **Questions you may have and considerations:**
      Budgeting and forecasting help predict future costs and plan resources better. Historical data and seasonal trends should be considered for accurate forecasts.  
    
    ## Scenario 5: Cost Control in Warehouse Replacement
    **Situation**: The company is planning to replace an existing Warehouse with a new one. The new Warehouse will reuse the Business Unit Code of the old Warehouse. The old Warehouse will be archived, but its cost history must be preserved.
    
    **Task**: Discuss the cost control aspects of replacing a Warehouse. Why is it important to preserve cost history and how this relates to keeping the new Warehouse operation within budget?
    
    **Questions you may have and considerations:**
    When replacing a warehouse, old cost data should be preserved for tracking and audits. This helps compare performance and keep the new warehouse within budget.
